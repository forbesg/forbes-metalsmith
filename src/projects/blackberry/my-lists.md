When you first start learning a new programming language, after a "Hello World"
program, the next thing to try is a to-do application.

I decided that I would use the BlackBerry WebWorks platform as a means to test
the script as well as to allow feedback from real users. This was also a platform that
didn't have a lot of applications of this type so I would be more likely to get
active users.

The design framework used is [bbUI.js](https://github.com/blackberry/bbUI.js/ "bbUI.js"),
which gives the application a native look & feel, with some additional styling
using CSS.

The list making script totals around 1000 lines of JavaScript and makes use of
HTML5 Local Storage to store the users lists on their device. Users can make,
manage and share their lists using BlackBerry's native messaging and social
applications.

I have used users feedback to implement new features, modify design and
fix some errors in behavior.
