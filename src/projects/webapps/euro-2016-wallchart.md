Continuing with my passion for Wallcharts, and to encorage my nephews to get involved
in the competition, I wrote the Euro 2016 WallChart.

My previous attempt for the 2014 World Cup was written entirely in vanilla JavaScript
so I wanted to try using a JavaScript framework to help me with the process and
focus on an Model View Controller approach.

As before, I used the clients Local Storage to persist the data as the wallchart was completed
by the user. As scores were entered, the tables would update the teams respective
played, point and goal difference figures and sort the table accordingly.

At the end of each stage, the qualifying teams would progress to the next round.

The application also automatically generated the days fixture list based upon the
date the user was visiting the page.

I also integrated Google Maps to view all the Stadia used for the competition. The
Blues Brothers in the map are my nephews :)
