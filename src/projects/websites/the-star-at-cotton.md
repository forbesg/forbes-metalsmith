I was asked to develop a new website for an old tradional country pub in the Staffordshire Moorlands.
Although the pub dates back to the 17th century, it was under new ownership and they were
looking for a more modern feel.

Their requirements included a mobile friendly design, and a user friendly content management
system to allow them to make updates to their frequently changing menu as well as adding
events that were being held at the pub.

The CMS that I chose was <a href="https://getgrav.org/" target="blank">GRAV</a>, an open source, flexible, flat file CMS
with a very user friendly backend user interface.

I designed the template for the site from scratch, liasing with the customer during the
design process using **PHP**, **TWIG** and **SCSS**.
